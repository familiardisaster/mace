Prototype of a web app fuzzer I built to learn more about sending async requests using Go. A much better solution is using Project Discovery's Nuclei tool. Unfortunatley, all of the tools I currently use are still closed-source and under development. I am making this repo public as a demo.

As a side note, this project is incomplete and should not be run. I was able to acheive a few hundred requests per second with the fuzzer which was my main goal.
